    "We have now introduced the basic law of magnetic induction,  Faraday's law, which demonstrates how a time-varying magnetic field induces a emf in a circuit. For any circuit carrying a time-varying current, we know that the current will generate a time-varying magnetic field, and the magnetic field will generate a time-varying flux through the circuit, which again will induce an emf in the circuit. In this chapter, we will model this effect in a circuit by introducing the self-inductance of the circuit. The self-inductance is defined as the flux per unit current in a way similar to how we introduced capacitance as the charge per potential difference or the resistance as the potential difference per unit current. We will demonstrate how we can introduce a new element in a circuit, an inductor, to represent the inductance of the circuit, and we will show how you can calculate the inductance of a circuit based on the geometry of the current-carrying components and the magnetic materials. We will extend the concept of inductance to also include how one circuit can induce an emf in another circuit --- through the mutual inductance of the two circuits, which again only depends on the geometry of the system. Finally, we will introduce the energy of the magnetic field in a capacitor in a way similar to how we introduced the energy of the electric field for a capacitor. \n",
