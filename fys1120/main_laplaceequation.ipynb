    "So far we have found the electric field $\\vec{E}$ from the spatial distribution of charges by either summing or integrating up the contributions to the electric field; by integrating the contributions to the electric potential and then taking the gradient of the potential to find the electric field; or in highly symmetric situations we can use Gauss' law on integral form to relate the electric field to the charge inside a Gauss surface. The integration methods are robust --- they work as long as we know the charge distribution --- but it can be difficult to find the integrals in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases is can be useful to reformulate the problem in a different form --- as a differential equation. We have in general found two sets of differential equations for the electric field: Gauss' law on differential form, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\rho/\\epsilon_0$; and that the curl of the electric field is zero, $\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = 0$. This gives us a set of partial differential equations that can be solved, but it may again be practically challenging. However, if we introduce the potential $V$ so that $\\vec{E} = - \\nabla V$, these equations can be reformulated in a simpler form because $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = -\\nabla^2 V = \\rho/\\epsilon_0$ and $\\nabla \\times \\nabla V = 0$ always because the curl or a gradient always is zero. This equation is called *Poisson's equation*. Together with appropriate boundary conditions, solving Poisson's equations gives us the potential which again gives us the electric field. Solving Poisson's equation is therefore equivalent to finding the potential or electric field from an integral over the charges that provides us with new, powerful tools to study electrostatic systems, but it requires new mathematical and numerical methods.\n",

    "In this chapter we will demonstrate how we can solve problems in electrostatics by solving Poisson's equation, we will demonstrate fundamental mathematical properties of the equations such as the uniqueness of solutions given a set of boundary conditions, and we will show how Poisson equation can be used to model complex electrostatic systems.\n",

When the electric field (that is, the potential difference) across a small (dielectric) region exceeds a maximum value, the charges (electrons) are no longer attached (bound), but are ripped from their bound positions, and become free. We call this *dielectric breakdown*. The result is the motion of charges, which we will discuss further down, but also that the potential effectively changes. However, in order to find out if and where there is dielectric breakdown we would need to find the electric field in space, for example by finding the electric potential.

    "You may therefore be tempted to use some of the techniques you already know for one-dimensional equations of motion. However, there are important differences. One difference may be in the boundary conditions. For Newton's equation we usually have an *initial value* problem. We know $x$ and its derivative at a given time $x(t_0) = x_0$ and $x'(t_0) = v_0$. For Laplace's equation we often have a boundary value problem, where we know the value of $V(x)$ for two different values of $x$, e.g. $V(a) = V_a$ and $V(b) = V_b$. This becomes particularly important for numerical solution methods. For an initial value problem we can simply integrate forward in time using a numerical, iterative scheme. However, for a boundary value problem, we cannot do this, since we need to ensure that we end up at a particular value $V(b) = V_b$. Thus we must use different numerical methods. Finally, Laplace's equation is generalized to a partial differential equation in higher dimensions, and Newton's equations do not have a corresponding generalization. We can therefore use some intuition from our previos experience, but we also need to build new intuition about partial differential equations and their solution methods.\n",

This is also not surprising at all, because the integral is the same as we would find for the potential of a uniform charge $q$ on the surface in a point at a distance $z$ from the center of the sphere, and in this case we know that the electric field from a uniformly charged sphere is the same as the potential from a single point charge at the center of the sphere, when the point is outside the sphere (if it is inside the sphere, the potential is zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "This must therefore also be true for the superposition of any set of charges outside the sphere. We have therefore proved that the potential in a point $\\vec{r}$ is the average of the potentials over a sphere centered in $\\vec{r}$. This implies that $V$ cannot have any local maxima or minima inside a region, they must occur at the boundaries. Because if $V$ had a maximum (or a minimum) in a point $\\vec{r}$, it would be possible to find a sphere around $\\vec{r}$ so that all the points on the sphere would be smaller than (or larger) than the value at $\\vec{r}$ --- this is what is means to be a local maximum/minimum.\n",

    "\n",
    "We also notice this *averaging property* of $V$: $V$ in a point is the average of the values on a sphere around that point. We will see that this is also the case for Laplace's equation on discrete form and forms the basis for a method to solve Laplace's equation --- the method of relaxation.\n",

    "### Laplace's equation has a unique solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this to prove that Laplace's equation has a unique solution in $v$ given that the values of $V$ on the boundaries are specified, $V(S)$. Let us assume that there are *two* solutions to Laplace's equation, $V_1$ and $V_2$, that both satisfy Laplace's equation in $v$. We then define $V = V_1 - V_2$. If the two solutions $V_1$ and $V_2$ are identical at the boundaries, we notice that $V$ must be zero at the boundaries. Because $V$ is a solution to Laplace's equation it cannot have a maximum or a minimum at the boundary, hence $V=0$ in the whole volume $v$, and we conclude that $V_1 = V_2$. The solution must therefore be unique. This implies that is does not matter how we find a solution: If we find a solution that satisfies the boundary conditions, then the solution is *the* solution, the unique solution to the problem.\n",

    "## Different types of boundary conditions\n",

    "### Dirichlet boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical boundary condition for Poisson's equation is to specify the value of the potential at the boundary. This type of boundary condition is called a *Dirichlet boundary condition*. Boundaries can be either the external boundaries or internal boundaries. Fig. [fig:laplace-boundary010](#fig:laplace-boundary010) illustrates boundary conditions for a one dimensional cases and a two-dimensional case. Dirichlet boundary condition here correspond to specifying the value of the potential at specific positions $V(x_i) = V_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### von Neumann boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of boundary condition is to specify not the value of $V$, but instead the derivative of $V$, $\\partial V/\\partial n$, in a given direction $n$, typically normal to the boundary. This type of boundary condition is called *von Neumann boundary conditions*. In the one-dimensional case, von Neumann boundary conditions corresponds to specifying $\\partial V/\\partial x$ at the boundaries, which corresponds to specifying the electric field at the boundaries, because $E_x = - \\partial V/\\partial x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same interpretation is valid in higher dimensions, where we interpret $\\partial V/ \\partial n$ as the gradient in the direction along $n$, which again is related to the electric field. A common type of von Neumann boundary conditions, is that the derivative is zero at the boundaries. In the case of the diffusion equation, we interpret von Neumann boundary conditions as the flux into the system at the boundaries. In the case of the electric potential, we can also interpret the von Neumann condition as the flux --- the flux of the electric field in the direction of $n$: $\\vec{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$, across a small surface area of size unity.\n",

What is we would like to only specify the potential at certain points inside the lattice, and not at the boundaries. Strickly, we would then need to have an infinite system, but this is not realistic in a numerical calculation. Instead, we can introduce a different type of boundary condition at the external boundaries - a Neumann boundary condition specifying the derivative $\\partial V/\\partial x$ or $\\partial V/\\partial y$ at the boundary. If we specify that the derivative is zero, this means that the potential is flattening out, but we do not specify at which value.

    "# Modeling: Lightning\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have the tools to start addressing lightning using our simplified model. We start by assuming that the top of our system represents a cloud with a potential $V_1$ and that the bottom represents the ground with a potential $V_0$. We now have the tools to calculate the potential $V(x,y)$ everywhere in the air using the numerical model. For simplicity we will scale the system so that the potential is $V_1 = 0$ at $B(x,L)$, because this corresponds to the top of the screen when we visualize the system in Python. (Python by default prints (0,0) in the top left corner of an image) and then we will assume that $V_0 = 1$ at $B(x,0)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we introduce a lightning in this case? We need a model for what happens during a lightning. We will assume that lightning propagates due to dielectric breakdown: Lightning propagates into regions of air and that cells where the potential difference is the largest, that is where the electric field is the largest, are most likely to have a dielectric breakdown. In addition, we will assume that the dielectric breakdown only can occur one cell at a time, starting from the cell with zero potential. Whenever a cell experiences a dielectric breakdown we will set the potential to be zero at this cell as well, because the cell becomes a good conductor due to the breakdown, so that the potential effectively is the same. (We will see in the next chapter that the potential is the same in a conductor, otherwise charges will flow until the potential is the same).\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we implement this in practice? We introduce a matrix `zeroneighbor`, which is `NaN` only in the points that are neighbors to a place where the potential is zero. This means that the lightning can only grow into cells where `zeroneighbor` is `NaN`. We then introduce a probability for the breakdown. We assume that sites with higher potential (difference, but since it is relative to a potential of zero, the difference is equal to the value in the cell) has a higher probability to experience dielectric breakdown. We assume that the probability is $P_i = c_i V_i^{\\eta}$, for a cell $I$ to break down, where $V_i$ is the potential (difference compared to zero). $\\eta$ is a parameter, which here is set to $\\eta = 1$, that is, the probability is proportional to the potential difference. We introduce randomness by selecting the value $c_i$ to be a number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The cell with the highest value of $P_i$ breaks down. When the cell breaks down, wechange the boundary conditions for Laplace's equation, since the boundaries are changed: The cell gets a potential $V_i = 0$. And we must also update `zeroneighbor` to ensure that the neighbor of the new cells also become possible new cells for the lightning to propagate into.\n",

    "# Modeling: Water droplet in electric field\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use our theory to explore what happens to a water droplet in an electric field. When we model a system such as this, we have to be precise and we have to determine what types of approximations we want to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, what do we mean by a water droplet? We assume that the droplet is round --- spherical --- with radius $a$. We will also assume that it does not change its shape. (We may want to modify this assumption, if we are adventurous). What is the difference between water and vacuum? You may think that water is a conductor, but clean water is generally not a conductor but instead a dielectric with dielectric constant $\\epsilon_r = 82$. If the water contains ions, it may indeed be conducting, but here we assume that it is a dielectric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model of is therefore a sphere of radius $a$ with dielectric constant $\\epsilon_r$. The droplet is placed in a uniform field. For simplicity, we place the uniform field along the $x$-axis. Our plan is to solve Laplace's equation numerically and analytically to find the potential $V$, and then find the electric field from the potential, $\\vec{E} = - \\nabla V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will find the electric field everywhere in this system in two ways: First by solving Laplace's equation numerically, and then by solving Laplace's equation analytically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We model the system on a $L \\times L$ lattice and want to find $V(x,y) = V(i \\Delta x, j \\Delta x) = V_{i,j}$ for $i,j = 0,1,\\ldots, L-1$ by solving Laplace's equation numerically. But how do we set up an external, uniform electric field? We know there is a uniform field between two plates. Therefore, we put one plate at $i = 0$ with potential $V_0$ and one plate at $i = L-1$ with potential $V_1$. The field will point from $i=0$ to $i=L-1$ is $V_0 > V_1$. We introduce a unit $V_0$ for the potential and set $V_{0,j} = V_0$ and $V_{L-1,j} = -V_0$. For simplicity, we measure all potentials in units of $V_0$ so that $V_{0,j} = 1$ and $V_{L-1,j} = -1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we model the sphere? First, we simplify the system and only study a two-dimensional slice through the center of the sphere --- a thin disk. (We expect the electric field to be entirely in this plane for all points in the plane, also in the full three-dimensional case). This disk has radius $a$ and is placed in the origin of our coordinate system at $i,j = L/2,L/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now need to implement Laplace's equation with non-uniform dielectric constant $\\epsilon$: $\\nabla \\cdot \\epsilon \\nabla = 0$, where we introduce $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$. However, $\\epsilon_0$ is uniform, so the equation becomes $\\nabla \\cdot \\epsilon_r \\nabla V = 0$, where $V$ is measured in units of $V_0$. In addition, we measure lengths in units of $\\Delta x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each point $i,j$ we define $\\epsilon_{r,i,j}(r)$, which depends on the distance $r$ from the origin. When $r<a$, $\\epsilon_{r,i,j} = 82$, whereas for $r \\le a$, $\\epsilon_{r,i,j} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modified Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "We modify the python code to include that $\\epsilon_r$ varies in space. We find $\\epsilon_{r,i+1/2,j}$ as the average of the values at $i,j$ and $i+1,j$: $\\epsilon_{r,i+1/2,j} = (\\epsilon_{r,i,j} + \\epsilon_{r,i+1,j})/2$. We also include periodic boundary condition{s in both directions to avoid edge effects. Periodic boundary conditions corresponds to solving the problem on top of a cylinder, so that $V_{L,j} = V_{0,j}$ and $V_{-1,j} = V_{L-1,j}$ (and similarly in the $y$-direction).\n",

We expect a similar effect here, although we need to study in detail how much the field is reduced.

Because there are no free charges in the system, the normal component of the displacement field is also continuous across the boundary at $r =a$.

You see that there is a $4$ on the diagonal (this would be 2 in one dimension and 6 in three dimensions), which corresponds to the $ 4 V_i$ in the equation. You also see that there is a $-1$ for each of the nearest neighbors: These are the $-1$ that are next to the 4 on the diagonal: $-V_{i+1,j}$ etc. These are replaced by zeros for some of the rows --- for the nodes that are next to a boundary. Then there are $-1$'s that are offset by two zeros. These correspond to the nodes that are on the row above or below the current row. The number of positions they are offset from the diagonal (with value 4) correspond to the number of nodes in a row.

We then insert a $-1$ for each neighbor $(i+1,j)$, $(i-1,j)$, $(i,j+1)$ and $(i,j-1)$ at the corresponding position in $A$, unless they are part of the boundary, in which case we instead add the boundary value to the $B$-vector.

If you try a high resolution (a large value of $N$) you will notice that the matrix $A$ mostly will contain zeros. We call such matrices *sparse*. There are more efficient methods to set up and solve sparce matrices in Python. In order to make the solution method efficient you will both need to implement this as a sparse matrix and you may need to be more careful in how you choose solution methods for solving the system of linear equations.

    "So far we have attempted to solve Laplace's equation by finding values of $V(x,y)$ on a lattice in such a way that the discretized version of Laplace's equation is satisfied on the lattice. Let us try a completely different approach: Let us describe $V(x,y)$ by a large set of parameters $w_j$: $V(x,y;w_j)$, and then we will try to choose values of $w_j$ so that $V(x,y;w_j)$ is a solution to Laplace's equation and satisfies all the boundary conditions. This is a very different approach to the finite difference scheme. In general, we do not expect to choose the parameters so that the function fits exactly, we will instead try to minimize the deviation from a solution that satisfies both the differential equation and the boundary conditions. To do this, we will use a neural network to reprensent the function $V(x,y;w_j)$, where the parameters are the weights and biases in the neural network. And we will use methods from machine learning to find a good set of parameters. This provides us with a continuous solution --- a solution for any point in the volume we are solving Laplace's equation. This example was inspired by an example by [Diogo Ferreira](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-solve-an-ode-with-a-neural-network-917d11918932).\n",
