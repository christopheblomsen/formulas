    "So far we have studied static charges. Now we will start to let them free. We will start to address the behavior of conductors, materials that have charges that are free to move around. In this chapter, we will study the properties of ideal conductors --- where charges can move freely around --- in equilibrium, that is, after the charges has settled down. Later, we will address non-ideal conductors and currents. We introduce the basic properties of ideal conductors, for example, that they have zero electric field inside and hence are equipotential surfaces, and both analytical and numerical tools to study electric field and charge distributions in and around condutors. Ideal conductors will be frequenly used as a model for real systems. For example, whenever we draw an electric circuit we will assume that all the wires we draw are ideal conductors, or we may assume that a part of a system is an ideal conductor to calculate the electric potential or field without knowing the detailed charge distribution.\n",

    "Conductors are materials that contain a large number of charges --- usually electrons --- that can move around in the material. Metals are a class of materials that behave as conductors. Metals are found to the left in the period table (see Fig. [fig:conductors-periodictable-010](#fig:conductors-periodictable-010)) and the electrons in metals behave as a sea of electrons that can move around with very little resistance. This is essentially a quantum mechanical effect, but you can gain some insight into this also from a classical model. Metals have weakly bound electrons in the outer shells, which in metallic crystals are essentially free to move around as illustrated in Fig. [fig:conductors-seaofelectrons-010](#fig:conductors-seaofelectrons-010). The metal may be neutral and still allow the electrons to move: the positive atoms remain, while the electrons move, allowing for a redistribution charges within the system. However, not only metals are conductors. Water with dissolved salt is also a conductor, because the positive and negative salt ions will move if an electric field is applied.\n",

    "The charges in a conductor experience a form of resistance from the material. We call this effect electric resistance and will discuss it in detail in Chapter\n",
    "In an *ideal conductor* we assume that the motion of the charges in response to an electric field is very rapid, so that it quickly reaches a state of equilibrium. What happens if we place an (ideal) conductor in an external electric field? This is illustrated in the sequence of figures in Fig. [fig:conductors-infield-010](#fig:conductors-infield-010). In the top figure, we illustrate the uniform electric field. Inside the circular condutor, there are charges that are free to move. Positive charges will move in the direction of the field (if they are free to move) and negative charges will move in the direction opposite the electric field. (If only the electrons can move, the remaining atoms will be positively charged, and the effect will be the same as if both positive and negative charges can move). The negative charges will move in the direction of $- \\vec{E}$ until it reaches the end of the conductor --- the surface. However, as the charges move, they will set up an electric field and change the total electric field in the system. The middle figures illustrate the electric field set up by the charges on the surface of the conductor. The charges will build up at the surface until the electric field inside the conductor is zero: If the electric field is not zero, the charges will continue to move. The bottom figure shows the sum of the external field and the field set up by the surface charges in equilibrium. The electric field will then be zero inside the conductor. What are the consequences of this for an ideal conductor?\n",

    "When the ideal condutor is in equilibrium, that is, when all the charges have finished moving, the ideal condutor will therefore have the following properties which also are illustrated in Fig. [fig:conductors-sphere-100](#fig:conductors-sphere-100):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero field inside a conductor\n",
    "\n",
    "The electric field is zero inside an ideal conductor, $\\vec{E} = 0$. If this was not the case, the electric field would move charges until they fall to rest on the surface of the conductor. The field from these charges will then compensate the external field so that the net field inside is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No free charges inside a conductor\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no free charges inside and ideal conductor. We can see this from Gauss' law: Beucase $\\vec{E}=0$ inside the conductor, Gauss' law on differential form gives $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0 = \\rho/\\epsilon_0$. All the charges must therefore be on the surface. The surface charge density is often called an *induced surface charge density*, since it is often the consequence of an external field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conductors are equipotential surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The conductor must be an equipotential surface because the electric field is zero inside the conductor. We can see this by finding the potential difference between two points A and B inside the conductor: $V_{AB} = \\int_A^B \\vec{E} \\cdot d \\vec{l} = \\int_A^B 0 d \\vec{l} = 0$. because $\\vec{E}=0$ inside the conductor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There is no tangential field immediately outside a conductor\n",
    "\n",
    "The tangential electric field is zero immediate outside the conductor. This is a consequence of the boundary conditions for the electric field and that the electric field is zero inside the conductor. The boundary condition across the boundary from inside to outside the conductor are $E_{2t} = E_{1t}$. Because $E_{t}$ is zero inside the conductor, $E_t$ must also be zero immediate outside the conductor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The electric field field immediately outside a conductor is $E_n = \\rho_s/\\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "The electric field immediately outside the conductor is normal to the surface of the conductor and is given as $E_n = \\rho_s/ \\epsilon_0$. Because the tangential component is zero, there can only be a normal component of the field immediately outside the conductor. We can find the magnitude of this field from the boundary conditions, which states that $D_{2n} - D_{1n} = \\rho_s$. On the inside the electric field and therefore also the displacement field is zero, $D_{1n}=0$. We therefore get that $D_{2n} = \\epsilon_0 E_n = \\rho_s$ and $E_n = \\rho_s/\\epsilon_0$ when the outside is vacuum. If the conductor is a dielectric, we need to divide by $\\epsilon$ instead. In gerenal, we therefore have that immediately outside the conductor $\\vec{E} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{n}} = \\rho_s/\\epsilon$. We can use this to find the electric field given that we know the surface charge density, and also the opposite: We can find the surface charge density from the electric field.\n",

    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A spherical ideal conductor with radius $a$ has a total charge $q$. Find the electrical potential and field everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we will use key properties of ideal conductors. We know that the electric field inside the condutor is zero and that all the charges are on the surface. There are several ways to approach this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We could use the spherical symmetry to assume that the charge is uniformly distributed on the surface. We have then mapped the problem onto a known problem --- the case of a charged, spherical shell with radius $a$. For this system we know that the electric field outside the shell is the same as for a point charge in the origin (the center of the sphere), that is, $\\vec{E} = E_r \\mathbf{\\hat{r}}$, $E_r = q/(4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r^2)$, and that the potential also will be the potential from a single point charge in the origin, $V(r) = q/(4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alternatively, we could use that the surface is an equipotential surface and then solve Laplace's equation. We leave this as an exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have formulated the problem differently, by instead saying that the spherical ideal condutor has a potential $V_0$. We can then still use the same approaches as before, but we would need to solve to find the charge $q$ from the potential $V_0$: $V_0 = q/(4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 a)$. However, for a problem formulated with the potential of the conductor, it may be tempting to instead use Laplace's equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More complex problem\n",
    "\n",
    "If the conductor is not a sphere, but a more complicated shape, such as a super-ellipse, then we generally cannot solve the problem analytically. We may then instead solve the problem numerically, by first solving Laplace's equation for the given set of boundary conditions, and then use the potential to find the electric field. We demonstrate this in the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method: Solving Laplace's equation with conductors\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous example suggests a general method to study systems with conductors. Such systems are important, because conductors and ideal conductors are common parts of electromagnetic models, systems and circuits. In such systems, we often place a conductor in contact with an electric potential at a given value. What does this mean? In practice, it may imply that we place it in contact with a battery with a given potential difference between its two poles. In our models or theoretical considerations, it means that the conductor has a given value of the potential, $V$. Because the conductor is an equipotential surface, it means that the whole conductor will be at the same potential. This means that systems with condutors can be addressed using Laplace's or Poisson's equation with the conductors are Dirichlet boundary conditions with a given value of the potential. In this case, we do not need to know the amount of charge present at the conductor, instead we know the potential. The distribution of charges can be calculated afterwards, when we have found the potential and the electric field. Thus we can propose a new method to find the electric potential and fields in electrostatic problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method for problems with conductors.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine what parts of the system are conductors and what their potentials are. These are the boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Solve Laplace's or Poisson's equation with the condutors as boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the electric field from the electric potential, $\\vec{E} = - \\nabla V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the surface charge density from the electric field, $\\rho_s = \\vec{E} \\nabla \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Numerical calculation of field from conductor\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply this method to find the electric field from a conductor with a non-trivial shape. Let us assume that a conductor shaped as a super-ellipse has a potential $V_0$ and that the potential is zero at inifinity. The shape of the super-ellipse is given as $(x/a)^n + (y/b)^n = 1$ where $n = 4$. What is the electric field and surface charge density for this system?\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to solve this problem numerically in the $xy$-plane. We generate a system of size $L \\times L$ and place the conductor with its center in $(L/2,L/2)$. The boundary conditions for the problem is that the potential is $V_0$ everywhere on the conductor and $0$ at infinity. Because we cannot model an infinite system, we may implement the outer boundary condition either by setting the potential to be $0$ at the outer boundary or by setting the potential to have zero derivative at the out boundary. (We can also study the difference between the two assumptions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we want to solve Laplace's equation (because there are no free charges): $\\nabla^2 V = 0$ on the square from $(0,0)$ to $(L,L)$. We set up the system to use our previously developed function `solvepoisson`. First, we set up the boundary conditions:"

This is a feature of using Laplace's equation and the properties of ideal conductors.

This is the charge that sets upt the electric field outside the conductor.\n",

We insert the value for $Q = 4\\pi \\epsilon a V_0$, getting, $E = V_0 a/r^2$. When $r \\rightarrow a$ this approaches $E = V_0/a$ on the surface.

    "The resulting plot of the magnitude of the electric field is shown in Fig. [fig:conductors-lightningcurvature-020](#fig:conductors-lightningcurvature-020). We see that the maximum of the magnitude of the electric field also in this case is close to the top of the sphere. The small deviations we observe close to the top we attribute to effects of the discrete lattice used for the numerical solution. We can perform several such simulations for various values of $a$ and study how $E_{\\max}$ depends on $a$. This is also plotted in Fig. [fig:conductors-lightningcurvature-020](#fig:conductors-lightningcurvature-020). We see that the magnitude of the field decays with increasing $a$, but not as fast as predicted from the simplified model. In the simplified model, we found that $E = V_0/a$. In the numerical simulation, we see that when we increase $a$ by a factor of 2, that is, from $a = 5$ to $a = 10$ in numerical units, the value of $E_{\\max}$ does not reduce by a factor of 2, but with a smaller factor. Here, we recall earlier issues we had with the difference between two-dimensional simulations and three-dimensional results. The numerical results here are really for a cylindrical geometry, and not with a sphere, and we therefore expect significant differences. We leave it as an exercise to study this problem in a three-dimensional system. (Notice that a three-dimensional simulation will require more computational resources).\n",

    "\n",
    "We know that immediately outside the conductor, the electric field in the normal direction is $E_n(z=0) = \\rho_s/\\epsilon$, and $E_t(z=0) = 0$. The electric field in in the plane at $z=0$ is a superposition of the field from the point charge $Q$ and the charges in the plane. Because the plane is a conductor, it is an equipotential surface. The electric potential is therefore the same everywhere on the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will introduce a *trick*. We can use the uniqueness property of the potential field. If we can find an electric potential that satisfies the boundary condition $V = 0$ on the plane, we know that this must be a unique solution to the problem. We therefore compare the two cases (a) and (b) illustrated in Fig. [fig:conductors-mirrorcharge010](#fig:conductors-mirrorcharge010). Case (a) corresponds to the charge $Q$ and the conducting plane, whereas case (b) corresponds to the charge $Q$ and a charge $-Q$ in a position mirrored across the conducting plane. For both these systems the potential is zero $z=0$. In the part $z>0$ we can solve Laplace's equation to find the electric potential with the given boundary condition at $z=0$ and the charge $Q$. This would give us a solution for $V$ for $z>0$. However, we also see that the system with the charge $Q$ and the mirror charge $-Q$ satisfies this boundary condition at $z=0$. The electric potential from the sum of the charge $Q$ and the charge $-Q$ must therefore be a solution to Laplace's equation for $z>0$. However, because the solution is unique, this is *the* solution to Laplace's equation for $z>0$. We have therefore found the potential using the method of mirror charges. We can then find the electric field from the electric potential, or we can simply find the electric field from the charge and the mirror charge, which very much simplifies the problem.\n",
