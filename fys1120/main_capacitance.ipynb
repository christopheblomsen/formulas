    "In this chapter we will introduce the concept of capacitance. Capacitance is a property of a component that tells us about its capacity to store electric charge. It depends on the geometry of the component: how the conductors are placed relative to each other. We call such components a capacitor, and we will frequently use such components as models of electrical properties of real systems or as components in electric circuits. In this chapter, we will focus on how the capacitance depends on the geometry of the system, how to calculate the capacitance of a system, and how to construct complex capacitors from several simple capacitors. We will also introduce the energy stored in a capacitor and use this to introduce the energy in an electric field.\n",

A capacitor is a thing and capacitance is the property of that thing.

We call such a configuration a parallel-plate capacitor. If the system starts as neutral and we move a charge $Q$ from the bottom plate to the top plate, the bottom plate will have a change $-Q$ and the top plate a charge $Q$. The electric field between the plates will point from the $+Q$ plate to the $-Q$ plate and the magnitude of the field will be $E = Q/(A \\epsilon)$ [^capacitance-footnote-010], where $A$ is the area of the plate. The difference in electrical potential for this constant electric field is then $V = Ed = Qd/(A \\epsilon)$. We define the *capacitance*, $C$, of this system as"

    "The capacitance $C$ defined as $C = Q/V$ is a property of the geometry of a system of conductors.

This implies that the ratio of the charge and the potential is a constant, independent of the charge.\n",

    "What does the capacitance tell about this system? As is hinted in the name, the capacitance describes a systems capacity to carry charge at a given potential difference. We see this from $C = Q/V$ which gives us $Q = C V$. The amount of charge the system can store at a given potential difference $V$ between two conductors is proportional to $C$. Thus if you were to carry us much charge as possible in a briefcase with a 9V battery to hold it, you would want to have a system with as large a capacitance as possible.\n",

A parallel-plate capacitor can be made very sensitive to small changes in the distance $d$ between the two plates, $C = A\\epsilon/d$, and this can be used to precisely measure nano-scale distances. A parallel-plate capacitor can also be very sensitive to small particles entering the area between the plates, effectively changing the dielectric properties of this area and thereby changing the capacitance.

We address the fields from each conductor independently, and then use the superposition principle to find the total field. We choose a cylindrical Gauss surface with top and bottom surface areas $A$ as illustrated in the figure.

We also assume that the electric field from the plate is symmetric around the plate.

    "First, we notice that we can increase the capacitance by decreasing the spacing $d$, or by increasing the area $A$ or the dielectric constant. What may be the disadvantage of decreasing the distance $d$ between the plates? We see that for a given $V$, the electric field is $E_z = (V/d)$. Decreasing $d$ while keeping $V$ constant will increase the charge stored in the capacitor, but also increase the electric field. If $d$ becomes too small, we may have dielectric breakdown, leading to the failure of the capacitor and charges leaking from one conductor to another.\n",

    "The electric field inside the conductor must be zero. How is this achieved in this system? When we calculate the electric field, it may be tempting to assume that the charge $Q$ is distributed uniformly on both surfaces (top and bottom) or the condutors. However, this would not be correct in this case. In the case of a single conductor with a net charge $Q$ alone in space, the charges would have to be distributed uniformly on both surfaces to ensure that the electric field is zero inside the conductor. However, in the case of two parallel conducting plates, it is the *total field* that must be zero inside the conductors: For the top conductor the total field is the sum of the electric field from the bottom conductor and the electric field from the surface charges on the top conductor. For the parallel plate system, there will be a surface charge density $\\rho_s = Q/A$ on the bottom side of the top plate and $-Q/A$ on the top side of the bottom plate. The electric fields from both of these sheets of charge will be non-zero only between the plates, everywhere else the superposition of the electric fields will be zero: both inside the conductors, above the top plate and below the bottom plate. This is clearly visible from the numerical solution in Fig. [fig:capacitance-geometry-010](#fig:capacitance-geometry-010), where we see that the potential is approximately uniform on the top side of the top plate and the bottom side of the bottom plate, indicating that that electric field is zero. \n",

However, in many cases we want to combine several capacitors with individual capacitances $C_i$ into one combined component with capacitance $C$. For example, we may connect several capacitor componets together, in parallel, in series or in a combination. In this case, we can derive expressions for the combined capacitance if we can assume that the capacitors are independent components that do not interact. What do we mean by not interacting? This means that the electric field from one component do not interact with another component, for example, leading to a displacement of the charge distribution. For a set of parallel plate capacitors this is usually the case, because the electric field outside of the space between the capacitors is generally very small. (We assumed it to be zero in the case of a thin and large capacitor).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us introduce a compact way to describe a system of several (non-interacting) capacitors. We do this in the form of a circuit diagram. A circuit diagram consists of a set of thin lines that represent ideal condutors connecting various parts of the components. In general, we do not care about the shape of these lines: We draw them as simple as possible often using straight lines, because the way we draw them has no impact on our system. (This will change when we discuss magnetic induction later). Because the lines represent ideal conductors, the electric potential is the same everywhere along the line: The lines connect components at the same potential. Fig. [fig:capacitance-circuitdiagram-010](#fig:capacitance-circuitdiagram-010) illustrates an example diagram. We draw a capacitor as two parallel plates. Notice that the potential on each side of the capacitor will not be the same, but will depend on the charge $Q$ on the capacitor. The voltage drop, the difference in potential across the component, is $V = C/Q$, where $Q$ is the charge on the capacitor. Usually, in circuits, we will have voltage sources that provide a given potential difference and not charge sources, so that we will know the potential difference $V$ and calculate the charge $Q = CV$.\n",

We also know that the electric field must be zero inside the outer conductor shell. How must the charges be organized to ensure this? We expect the charge distribution and the electric field to have spherical symmetry. We can use Gauss' law on a spherical Gauss surface inside the outer conductor. The electric field on this surface must be zero, and therefore the net charge inside the Gauss surface must be zero. The net charge on the surface at $R_1$ is $+Q$. The net charge on the surface at $R_2$ must therefore be $-Q$ to ensure the net charge to be zero. All the $-Q$ charge on the outer shell is therefore on the inner surface at $R_2$.\n",

This is done by collecting 1000 data points over 1 minute of the charge $Q$ at the discharging plate. The data points are stored in `dischargeData.dat`.

    "This tells us that if we plot the logarithm of the data points we should expect a linear graph, and the slope of this graph should be $-1/RC$. Our aim is to obtain this slope value through numerical methods. There are several ways of accomplishing this, but in Python one of the easiest methods is through `scipy.stats`'s `linregress`-function that performs a linear regresseion (which finds the linear function that best fits a dataset) and returns several values, of which the first two are the slope and intercepting point of the approximated linear function. (A good habit is to always read the official documentation for an imported function before using it) With the slope calculated, we can solve $-1/RC$ for $C$ and obtain the capacitance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus we can check our answer by using that the intercepting value of the linear graph should equal $\\ln (CV)$ which can be solved for $C$. As any collected data most likely would contain a certain amount of noise, a smart conclusion to this exercise would be to take the average of the two $C$-values (one from the slope and one from the intercepting point) that we computed.\n",
