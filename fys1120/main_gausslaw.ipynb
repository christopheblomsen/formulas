    "We have learned that we can find the electric field for any distribution of electric charges. In this chapter, we will introduce Gauss' law, which provides a different approach to finding the electric field. We will introduce Gauss' law on integral form and demonstrate how this law can be used to find the electric field in systems with a high degree of symmetry. We will also demonstrate that Coulomb's law is a consequence of Gauss' law and vice versa. Gradually, as you build intuition for electromagnetism, you will see that Gauss' law appears to be more fundamental that Coulomb's law and provides you with a very compact description of the laws of electromagnetism. Gauss' law will also be our first encounter with one of Maxwell's equation which provide a beautify and compact descripion of electromagnetism. Here, we will focus on building up the basic concepts needed to apply Gauss' law: flux, symmetries, and surface and volume integrals. We will learn to apply Gauss' law in a variety of cases, and understand both its limitations and its strength.\n",

    "We look for symmetries in this system. First, we notice that the line charge is along the $z$-axis. We therefore expect the field to be symmetric around the $z$-axis. First, let us use a cylindrical coordinate system.  We can write $\\vec{E}$ in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, where $r$ is the distance to the $z$-axis, $\\theta$ is the angle around the $z$-axis with $\\theta=0$ along the $x$-axis, and $z$ is the position along the $z$-axis. Using this coordinate system we have that $\\vec{E} = E_r \\mathbf{\\hat{u}}_r + E_{\\theta} \\mathbf{\\hat{u}}_{\\theta} + E_z \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$, where $\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}_r$, $\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}_{\\theta}$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$ are unit vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the field to depend on the distance from the $z$-axis, but not on the angle around the axis. The symmetry therefore implies that $E_r(r,\\theta,z)$ only depends on $r$ and $z$, $E_r = E_r(r,z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the line is infinite along the $z$-axis, we expect the system to look the same no matter where we are along the $z$-axis. Thus we do not expect any $z$-dependence in the field. $E_r = E_r(r)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the field will look like $\\vec{E} = E_r(r) \\mathbf{\\hat{u}}_r + E_{\\theta}(r) \\mathbf{\\hat{u}}_{\\theta}$. Finally, what about the field in the $\\theta$-direction? Here, there are two arguments: Either we could argue that since the charge distribution is the same in both the positive and negative $z$-direction, we do not expect the $\\theta$-direction to break that symmetry. Alternatively, we can argue that since the electric field around any closed loop, $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{d} \\vec{l} = 0$, then we see that $\\oint E_{\\theta} \\mathrm{d} l = 2 \\pi r E_{\\theta} = 0 \\, \\Rightarrow \\, E_{\\theta} = 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have the symmetry of the problem written down in terms of how the electric field depends on the various variables. Usually, we do not need to be *this* systematic. I expect that you will be able to see such symmetries immediately and write down the corresponding form of the electric field.\n",

    "\n",
    "With a cylindrical symmetry, we use a sylinder around the $z$-axis as the surface for Gauss' law.
