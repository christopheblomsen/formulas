    "We now have all the components we need to start to describe and model systems as *circuits*. \n",
    "In this chapter we will introduce the concept of an electric circuit and develop the methods and tools needed to analyze, model and study electric circuits and the systems the are used to model. We will explain why charges are transported along a conductor, independently of its shape. We will introduce an efficient notation for various types of components such as (good) conductors (wires), resistors and capacitors. We will introduce and demonstrate Kirchoff's law of potentials and of currents and how they are used to describe circuits. Circuits can be used as simplified models for complex situation, and we will demonstrate how to simplify physical systems to simplified circuits. We will also introduce analytical and numerical methods to solve complex problems formulated as circuits --- allowing you to understand and explore more complex physical phenomena such as signal propagation along nerve cell membranes, eddy currents and flow in disordered materials.\n",

    "We solved this problems previously and found that the current density $\\vec{J} = \\sigma \\vec{E}$ is parallel with the conductor as illustrated in the figure. The current density cannot have any component normal the to condutor, as this would indicate that charges are leaking from the conductor out into the vacuum outside. Therefore, the electric field also cannot have any component normal to the conductor. (In the figure on the right we have shown the current density for clarity. The electric field will generally not be zero outside the conductor, but it will only have a tangential component immediately outside the conductor).\n",
    "\n",
    "But why does the electric field change when the conductor is added? Immediately after the conductor is added to the system, we will expect the electric field to be as illustrated on the left. As a consequence, charges will also move in directions normal to the conductor. However, these charges will not move outside the conductor, but stop at the outer surface of the conductor. This will change the electric field inside the conductor, and this process will continue until the surface charge ensure that there is no electric field normal to the surface of the conductor. Then we will have reached the situation in the figure on the right. This process is very fast, and we can effectively think of it as immediate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar process occurs in a conductor that is curved. Fig. [fig:circuits-conductors-012](#fig:circuits-conductors-012) illustrates a conductor with a curve. When an electric potential difference is applied across the ends of this conductor, electric charges will pile up on the surface of the conductor until the electric field, and therefore also the current density, does not have a component normal to the surface of the conductor. The end result is that the electric field will point along the conductor as illustrated in the figure. Again, this process is effectively immediate. This means that we do not need to think about the shape of the conductor. The electric field and the current will follow whatever shape the conductor has. Typically, when we make a drawing of a system with a conducting wire we will not care too much about the shape of the wire, but instead draw the wire in a way that is practical.\n",

We realize that along the good conductor, the potential is essentially constant. This means that the shape or length of the ideal conductor does not matter. (At least not yet, it will matter later when we introduce inductance). We therefore often draw good conductors as straight lines.

    "The conductor consists of two parts: A good conductor (a copper wire) and a bad conductor (forming a resistor). We have drawn the good conductor as a thin line and we draw the bad conductor as a rectangle, which is still a conductor, but with much lower conductivity than the wire. Notice that the potential is not the same on each side of the resistor: There is a potential drop, $V = V_1 - V_0$, across the resistor. We characterize a resistor with a resistance $R$. (You know how to calculate the resistance if you know the shape of the resistor.) For a resistor we know that the voltage drop is related to the current through $V = R I$, where $V$ is the voltage drop across the resistor, $I$ the current through the resistor and $R$ is the resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now simplified the real system with an ideal system with two types of components: An ideal conductor drawn as a line and a resistor with resistances $R$ respectively. We will often also simplify a real conductor, with a finite conductivity in this way, as a wire that is effectively an ideal conductor with zero potential drop connected in series with a resistor that represents the potential drop in the wire.\n",

    "## Charge conservation and the water analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do the charges go in the diagram in Fig. [fig:circuits-diagram-015](#fig:circuits-diagram-015)? In this case positive charges are transported from high potential $V_1$ to the lower potential $V_0$. If this was the complete circuit, we would expect charges to build up at $V_0$ and be removed at $V_1$, gradually resulting in an increase in the potential $V_0$ and a decrease in potential at $V_1$ until they are equal an no more current would flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the potential difference and to keep the current flowing, we insert an element in the circuit called a voltage source or a *battery*. (See the symbol used in the figure). We will not go into the detailed workings of a battery here, but will simply assume that the potential of a charge is increased as it passes through the battery. This is illustrated in Fig. [fig:circuits-diagram-030](#fig:circuits-diagram-030). Here, we have drawn the changes in the electric potential, which corresponds to the changes in the potential energy of a positive charge as it moves through the system. We may use a water analogy to guide our intuition about this system. When the charge moves along a wire, it does not change its potential. This is like a flat water channel. When the charge moves through a resistors, it decreasea its potential. This is like a water-fall. When the charge moves through a battery, it increases its potential. This is like an elevator: It lifts the water up.\n",

    "We combine Kirchoff's voltage law and Kirchoff's current law to find the currents and voltage drops in the circuit illustrated in Fig. [fig:circuits-diagram-050](#fig:circuits-diagram-050)b. We recall that the lines indicate ideal conductors. All points along a line has the same potential. The potential is illustrated by the color of the dots at the junctions.

    "\n",
    "If we apply Kirchoff's voltage law to the loop $C_2$, we see that the direction of the loop is opposite the direction of the currents, so that the voltage change over that battery is $-e$ and the voltage change over resistor $R_A$ is $R_A I_A$ so that $\\sum_i \\Delta V_i = -e + I_A R_A = 0$ and $I_B = e/R_A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then apply Kirchoff's current law to any of the junctions. We use the currents flowing out of the left junction. The two currents $I_A$ and $I_B$ are flowing out of this junction and the current $-I$ is also flowing out of this junction (since $I$ is flowing into the junction). Kirchoff's current law therefore gives $\\sum_i I_i = -I + I_A + I_B = 0$ and $I = I_A + I_B$, which indeed corresponds to our intuitive understanding: The current $I$ flowing into the junction must equal the currents $I_A$ and $I_B$ flowing out of the junction to converve currents.\n",

    "Instead of applying Kirchoff's voltage law to loop $C_2$ We could also have applied Kirchoff's law to the loop $C_3$: $\\sum_i \\Delta V_i = -I_A R_A + I_B R_B = 0$. Notice that the voltage drop across $R_B$ is positive, because the direction of the loop is in the opposite direction to the direction of the current $I_B$.

    "The system described in Fig. [fig:circuits-diagram-050](#fig:circuits-diagram-050)b has three unknowns, $I$, $I_A$ and $I_B$. In general, we can think of circuits as setting up systems of linear equations. (Sometimes systems of linear differential equations, as we will soon see). We then need a number of linearly indepedent equations to find the unknowns, and we find these equations from Kirchoff's laws and the definitions of voltage drops across resistors ($\\Delta V = I R$) and other components. For the system in Fig. [fig:circuits-diagram-050](#fig:circuits-diagram-050)b we may get five equations: one for the application of Kirchoff's voltage law for each of the three loops, and two from the application of Kirchoff's current law for each of the two junctions. These equations will not be linearly independent: Kirchoff'c current law for the two junctions will be the same, and there are only two independent equations from the three loops. However, for more complicated circuits, it may be difficult to recognize which laws give independent equations. You should then instead use standard procedures from linear algebra. For example, you can find all the relevant equations, and then reduce them to only the linearly independent ones using numerical or symbolic methods. (We demonstrate this in the exercises.)\n",

    "Circuits can be real systems that you build yourself or they can be simplified models of real systems that allow us to address them using our knowledge of electromagnetics. For example, we know how to describe a real wire with a finite conductivity as illustrated in Fig. [fig:circuits-models-010](#fig:circuits-models-010). However, if we want to include this wire in a description of a more complex system, we want to simplify its description. This can be done as illustrated in the figure as a system consisting of a wire of an ideal conductor, drawn as a line in the circuit diagram, connected in series with a resistor that represents the resistance of the whole wire. This is an example of a circuit model of a real system. The goal is that you should be able to simplify complex physical systems to simpler circuit-based systems and then analyze them using your knowledge of electromagnetics. Let us demonstrate this by a few examples.\n",

    "A cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer with embedded ion channels and ion pumps. The lipid bilayer consists of a set of two layers of lipid molecules. Each lipid molecule is approximately linear, like a somewhat flexible rod. The lipid molecules are amphiphilic, which means that one end of the molecule is hydrophobic and one end is hydrophilic. In the outer lipid layer the hydrophilic end points outwards, while in the inner lipid layer the hydrophilic end point into the cell. The outside of the lipid bilayer is therefore polar, which means that the molecules form hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water molecules. The inner part of the lipid bilayer is non-polar. The lipid bilayer functions as a membrane, so that molecules that are on the outside of the layer cannot easily get through the layer. This allows cells to have different chemistry on the outside and inside of the cell membrane. See Fig. [fig:circuits-cellmembrane-010](#fig:circuits-cellmembrane-010) for an illustration.\n",

    "Cell membranes are not completely impermeable. They have various different types of channels in the form of complex molecules, proteins, that allow some molecules or ions to flow through the cell membrane. *Ion pumps* use energy to pump ions from one side of the membrane to the other. For example, the sodium-potassium pump, in each cycle transports three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell. Since both ions have a charge of $+e$, this means that the pump builds up a charge difference between the outside and the inside of the cell. Due to this pump, the outside of the cell will have positive charge and the inside will have negative charge. There will therefore be an electric field from the outside of the cell to the inside of the cell. The inside of the cell will therefore have a lower electric potential than the outside. The ion pump uses chemical energy to perform work to transport charges across this potential. In addition, there are leaky ions channels that allows for example potassion ions to flow back into the cell. The net effect of both the ion pumps and ion channels for several types of ions is that there typically is a potential difference across the cell membran is about $-80 \\text{mV}$ called the membrane potential for nerve cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can be create a simplified model of this system? Fig. [fig:circuits-cellmembrane-020](#fig:circuits-cellmembrane-020)a contains a first iteration of a model. The cell membrane is illustrated as a dielectric medium of a given thickness and surface area. This represents a capacitor with a capacitance of $C = A \\epsilon/d$. We assume that ion channels and ion pumps are small compared to the area and therefore do not affect the capacitance. But how should we represent the ion pump and ion channels in a model? The ion pump acts as a battery: It lifts charges up through a potential difference. We assume that all the ion pumps in total act as one battery with a voltage $e$. The ion channels acts as a leaky channel for ions: They will flow through the channel if there is a potential difference, but with some resistance. A potential difference is needed to drive the ions through the channel. We therefore model all the ion channels as one resistor with resistance $R$.\n",

This is a simplified model of one aspect of the physics of a cell membrane, and we can use this model to address the electrical properties of the cell membrane. We can ask questions like, what happens if the ion pump stops pumping? What happens if we change the number of ion channels and therefore change the resistivity of the leaky channel? We can answer these questions by studying the circuit and describing its behavior.\n",

    "We can also improve this detail of this model. For exampel, we can assume that each ion pump has a voltage $e_0$ and that there is a given density $N_P$ of ion pumps on the surface. The total number of ion pumps is then $N_P A$. The total effect of all of these pumps is like having $N_P A$ batteries in parallel, which is like having one battery with a total voltage of $e = N_P A e_0$. Similarly, we can assume that there is density $N_C$ of ion channels. Each ion channel contributes with a resistivity $R_0$ and there are $N_C A$ such resistors in parallel. The total resistivity is therefore $1/R = N_C A /R_0$.\n",

To make a model of this system, we divide the cylindrical axon into smaller cylindrical part of length $\\Delta L$. The potential outside the cell is $V_e$. We model the behavior inside each such element by a single voltage $V_i$, in the middle of element $i$. The cell membrane acts as a capacitor with a capacitance $C$ (which you know how to calculate for a cylindrical element), and there is a leaking current through the cell membrane through channels with an effective resistance $R$ for each element. The capacitor $C$ and the resistor $R$ acts in parallel for each such element.\n",

Notice that the value of $V$ falls vary rapidly as we study the system for larger values of $x$. This makes it difficult to interpret the results. We have therefore instead plotted $V(x,t)/V_{\\max}$, where $V_{\\max}$ is chosen so that when we plot $V(x,t)$ as a function of $t$ for a given $x$ it is the maximum of $V$ over $t$ for that given $x$, and similarly when we plot $V(x,t)$ as a function of $x$ for a given $t$ it is the maximum of $V$ over $x$ for that given $t$.

    "We now know how to set up the system of linear equations that we can solve with Python's linear equation solvers. However, first we need to set up the matrix $A_{n,m}$ and the vector $B_n$. We do this by looping through all elements $(i,j)$, and then inserting all the relevant values for the equation used to determine $V_{i,j}$. For each neighbor $(k,l)$ to $(i,j)$ we insert the values from the equation $G_{(i,j),(k,l)}(V_{i,j} - V_{k,l}) = 0$, taking into consideration the value for the conductance and the whether the element is a boundary element or and internal element. We write a function to set up the system equations, solve the system, and put the values back into an array of $V_{i,j}$ values as well as two arrays of the currents. This is done in the following program:"

    "The resulting plot is show in Fig. [fig:circuits-porous-040](#fig:circuits-porous-040) for four different values of $p$. Here, we observe interesting properties of the system. First, we realize that there is a value for $p$ below which there is no flow from one side to another. This values if called the percolation threshold for the system. For the system we have chosen for the random connections, which is called a bond percolation lattice (because it is the bonds, the connections between the elements, that are chosen at random), the percolation threshold for a square lattice is known to be for $p = 1/2$. If we choose $p$ below $1/2$, there is typically no connecting path from one side to another, whereas if $p>1/2$, there is a connecting path. Just at $p = 1/2$ the system behaves as a fractal, with a complex geometrical structure which is clearly evident also from the way the current is distributed in the system in Fig. [fig:circuits-porous-040](#fig:circuits-porous-040).
