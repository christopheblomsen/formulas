    "In electrostatics we started from Coulomb's law, which we used to find the electric field, and used this to derive Gauss' law, $\\nabla \\cdot D = \\rho$, which is useful for symmetric situations (and for forming Maxwell's equations which we can solve numerically). In addition we found that the electric field (in electrostatics) is curl-free: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0$. These laws for the foundation of Maxwell's equations and have proved important tools for the development of magnetostatics.\n",

    "In magnetostatics, we have so far introduced Biot-Savart's law to find the magnetic field. In this chapter, we will introduce Ampere's law, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}$, which is what corresponds to Gauss' law for magnetic fields. In addition, we will argue that the magnetic field is divergence free, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, which is equivalent to stating that there are no magnetic monopoles. In combination, these two laws for a powerful theoretical tool that allows us to find expressions for the magnetic field in situations with a high degree of symmetry. \n",
