    "In this chapter we will introduce the concept of electric (scalar) potential. This is a powerful and important concept in electromagnetism both conceptually and computationally. Here, we will develop the concept in analogy with your intuition from gravitational fields and potential energy. We will define the electric potential and demonstrate how we can find the potential from the electric field and the electric field from the potential. We will introduce the potential from a single charge, from a set of charges and from continuous charge distributions. In many situations, it is easier to calculate the electric potential than the electric field. We will therefore use the potential as a method to find the electric field. We will demonstrate how to find the electric potential numerically, visualize the potential and calculate the corresponding electric field. Hopefully, when you have finished this chapter you will have built an intuition for the electric potential and skills on how to calculate it. And you should be able to use the potential to analyze more complex electrostatic situations.\n",

    "\n",
    "You most probably have heard the term potential directly or indirectly. You may know that a battery has a voltage of 1.5 Volts. This term voltage refers to the electric potential between the two poles of the battery. Similarly, you may have heard about high voltage as found in power lines or even more extremely in lightning strikes. (Fig. [fig:potential-motivation-010](#fig:potential-motivation-010). But how does this concept of voltage correspond to the concept of the electric field? We will try to build this intuition here.\n",

Gravity is a conservative force field --- a force acting everywhere in space on masses due to particles with masses. You may recall that for a conservative force the potential energy was defined as"

How can we use the potential to gain insight into the electric field? We know that the electric field is given at $E_x = - \\partial V/\\partial x$ in the one-dimensional case. The electric field therefore points from a high potential toward lower potentials. In Fig. [fig:potential-equipotential-015](#fig:potential-equipotential-015)a the electric field points to the right as illustrated by the arrow. The field is proportional to the slope of the potential. Here, the slope is constant, which means that the electric field is uniform.

The gradient is normal to the equipotential surface and points in the direction that $V$ increases the fastest. Since $\\vec{E} = - \\nabla V$, we see that the electric field is normal to the equipotential surface and points in the direction that $V$ decreases the fastest.

    "An important aspect in physics is *modeling* --- how we take a physical system and develop a simplified model that we can address theoretically. How can we address a problem like finding the electric potential from a water molecule? We do not really know what the charge distribution is for a water molecule. And the charge distribution may depend on the situation: Is the water molecule alone? Is it close to other water molecules? Is it close to a charged surface? When we model, we need to make reasonable assumptions, and we will train making such assumptions gradually. However, to some degree this requires courage and curiosity --- you need to dare to make a simple model and you need to explore the consequences.\n",

We will then assume that the angle between the hydrogen atoms is $\\theta = 104.5^{\\circ}$ and that the distance between the oxygen and the hydrogen atom is $a = 0.95 \\text{\\AA}$ [[csaszar2005]](#csaszar2005). These values are taken from scientific articles, but you could also have chosen reasonable values --- at least reasonable enough for our purposes from a simple web search. However, you should always provide information about where you have found the values you use.\n",

This will most probably feel uncomfortable, because we are used to answer questions, not pose the questions ourselves. However, this project aims to introduce you to how we think about and use physics in practice, and as you would be using physics as a tool in research or development.\n",

We suggest that you use a Jupyter notebook to develop your project.\n",

    "What is the electric field and potential around a $\\text{CO}_2$ molecule? We start by finding a simplified model for the charge distribution of the $\\text{CO}_2$ molecule: We place a charge $2q$ to represent the C in the origin and a charge $-q$ in positions $(-a,0,0)$ and $(a,0,0)$. This system we can solve exactly. We find the potential and field along the $x$-axis analytically and plot the results. Then we find the potential and field in the $xy$-plane, and visualize the results. We study how the electric field decays when $r \\rightarrow \\infty$ by plotting $\\log_{10}(E)$ as a function of $\\log_{10}(x)$ for $x\\gg a$. We write a brief Jupyter notebook describing the results.\n",

    "What is the electric potential and electric field inside a box with charged surfaces? The full model is in two dimensions as a square box centered in the origin with sides $2L$ and a charge $Q$ uniformly distributed on each of the four sides. First, we simplify the model to consist of four charges, $Q$, placed at the center of each of the four sides. We find the electric potential and field in the center of the box for this system. We also calculate the electric potential and field along the $x$-axis. Then we use 100 charges to model each of the 4 sides (400 charges in total) to calculate the potential and the electric field. We visualize the potential and field in space and compare the solution with the simplified model. Is the model ok along the $x$-axis. Where in the box are the deviations the greatest between the simplified model and the full model? We write a brief Jupyter notebook to describe the study. You can vary this study by e.g. choosing different charges on the various four sides, studying a three-dimensional system and comparing with a two-dimensional system and so on.\n",
