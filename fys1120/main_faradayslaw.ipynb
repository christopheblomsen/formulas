    "So far we have only studied systems without any time variation, in electro-*statics* and magneto-*statics*. Now, we will start studying dynamic systems, in electro-*dynamics*. So far we have learned that charges generate electric fields (Gauss' law) and that currents generate magnetic fields (Ampere's law). We will now see that we can generate electric and magentic fields in a different way: A magnetic field that charnges (in time) generates an electric field and an electric field that changes (in time) generates a magnetic field. This ensures a nice symmetry, which is essential for the laws of electromagnetics to be the same across inertial systems. We will show that an emf, an electromotoric force, is generated in a circuit moving through a magnetic field. But, in the reference frame of the circuit, this may look like a time-varying magnetic field through the circuit. Faraday's law has this duality built-in: it is the rate of change of the flux through the circuit that induces an electromotoric force, independently of whether the change is due to a moving circuit or a time-varying magnetic field. However, in order to introduce Faraday's law, we need a new concept, the electromotoric force, which means that we need to start from revisting the electric field in circuits.\n",

    "What is driving the current flowing in a circuit? Fig. [fig:faradayslaw-emf-010](#fig:faradayslaw-emf-010) illustrates a circuit with a parallel-plate capacitor $C$, a wire with a finite conductivity and a resistor $R$. If the capacitor is charged up so that there are positive charges on the top side of the capacitor, there will be an electric field along the wire. As we discussed before, after a brief initial reorganization of charges on the surface of the wire, the electric field in the wire will point along the wire. In the resistor, the electric field is pointing from the high to the low potential as illustrated. The current is driven by the potential difference of the capacitor, but will eventually decay as charge is transported from the positive to the negative side of the capacitor.\n",

    "Instead of a capacitor, we could insert a mechanical battery. We could insert a device that would move a positive charge from the lower side to the upper side of the capacitor. This would require an external force. Inside the capacitor, there is an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$. In order to move a charge from the lower side to the upper side of the capacitor, we would need a force per unit charge, $\\mathbf{f}$, which is at least $\\mathbf{f} = - \\mathbf{E}$. This force would a property of the internal mechanics of the battery, or more generally, of any another mechanism that has the same effect as the battery of providing an external force per unit charge.\n",

Let us see what happens if we start this system from a neutral state, and then suddenly turn on a force that moves electrons to the right. The force on the first electron will only be from the external force. After a while, electrons will have moved to the left to the right, so that the right side will be negatively charged and the left side positively charged. Thus, there will be an additional force acting on the charges from the electric field. Eventually, the system will reach an equilibrium, so that the external force is equal to the electric field, that is, $\\mathbf{E} = - \\mathbf{f}_{NC}$. In this case, the potential difference will be $V = F_{NC} s /e = f_{NC}s $, where $s$ is the distance between the plates.

    "That was a complicated question, but it has a surprisingly simple answer. Let us analyze the behavior in the system in detail. Let us assume the permanent magnet and the circuit is oriented as in the figure. When the perment magnetic is moved towards the circuit, the magnitude of the magnetic field on the surface $S$ encompassed by the circuit increases with time. Because the flux is negative, this means that the flux decreases with time. The induced emf is $e = - \\mathrm{d} \\Phi / \\mathrm{d} t$ and it increases with time. Therefore, the current $I$ increases with time. The magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_I$ from this current is oriented in the direction opposite of the magnetic field from the permanent magnet and the magnitude of $B_I$ increases with time. Therefore, the magnetic field set up by the current induced by the change in flux acts in a direction opposite of the change in the field that caused the current.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result is general and is called *Lenz law*: The direction of the current in the circuit is such that the magnetic field generated by the current will counteract the change in magnetic field that caused the current. This was a rather complex formulation. It can be simplified to \"Nature counteracts changes in magnetic flux\". If the flux is changed, the system will set up a current to generate a magnetic field, that will counteract the change. This is a very useful tool the check the sign of Faraday's law.\n",
