    "So far we have only addressed the electric field in a vacuum. What happens with the electric field inside a material such as water, a ceramic, or a metal? We will start by addressing how the electric field behaves inside an insulator and then later discuss the electric field inside a conductor. Inside an insulator, the charges are bound. An imposed electric field will displace the bound charges small distances, causing many small dipoles to be formed. These dipoles can be described as a distribution of bound charges, which will induce an electric field, which in turn will change the total electric field in the material. We will introduce the polarization vector, $\\vec{P}$ to describe the average effect of the dipoles, the spatial distribution of bound volume charges, $\\rho_{b,v}(\\vec{r})$ and surface charges $\\rho_{b,s}(\\vec{r})$, and the displacement field $\\vec{D}$. We will demonstrate that we can introduce a modified version of Gauss' law for $\\vec{D}$ that only depends on the free and not the bound charges. This provides us with a set of tools to extend our electrostatic theory to dielectric materials.\n",

    "A dielectric or an insulator is a material with very litte free charges such as (pure) water, a ceramic, plastics, or glass. We discern between two types of dielectric: *polar* and *non-polar* as illustrated in Fig. [fig:polarization-nonpolar-010](#fig:polarization-nonpolar-010). Polar systems consist of many small, permanent dipoles such as water molecules, that align with an external electric field, whereas a non-polar system consist of many small atoms with charge distributions that are displaced by an imposed electric field. What are the effects of these alignments or displacements?\n",

    "In a non-polar dielectric without any electric field, the electrons are distributed symmetrically around the positive charges, so that there are no net dipoles. However, if we apply an external electric field, the electron clouds around atoms or molecules tend to be displaced: The negative electron cloud will be displaced in a direction opposite the electric field, whereas the positive nucleus is displaced in the opposite direction. The net result is illustrated in Fig. [fig:polarization-nonpolar-010](#fig:polarization-nonpolar-010). An equilibrium will form between the electric field pulling the electrons and the nucleus apart and the attractive forces between the negative electrons and the positive nucleus drawing them back together. As a result, each atom becomes a small dipole because of a small displacement of the electron cloud around the atom. The stronger the field, the more the electron cloud will be displaced, and the stronger is each dipole. We expect the induced dipole moment $\\vec{p}$ of an individual atom to be proportional to the electric field:"

However, if the electric field is too strong, the atom will be pulled completely apart, ionizing it, such as in a lightning. The free ions and electrons then become a conducting material. (For systems consisting of molecules or crystals, the situation is a bit more complicated as they may polarize more easily in some directions than in order.

    "## Example: Simple model for atomic polarizability\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of our modeling approach, let us see how we can make a simplified model for atomic polarizability. We model an atom as a nucleus with charge $q$ and the surrounding electronic cloud as a uniform, spherical distribution of charge with radius $a$ and total charge $-q$. When the atom is put in an external electric field $E_0$, the nucleus and the electron cloud are displaced a distance $d$, which we assume is (much) smaller than $a$. We recall, that the electric field at a distance $r$ from the center inside a uniform, spherical charge distribution is $E_r(r) = q r/(4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3)$. In equilibrium, the force at a distance $d$ between the nucleus and the electric cloud must be equal to $E_0$, so that $E_0 = qr/(4 \\pi \\epsilon_0)$, which means that $p = qd = (4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3) E_0 = \\alpha E_0$ so that $\\alpha = 4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 a^3$. It turns out that this model is within a factor four for many simple atoms.\n",

    "## Polar dielectric\n",
    "\n",
    "In a polar dielectric the electrons are distributed relative to the positive charges so that molecules behave as individual dipoles. An example is water. Each water molecule is a small dipole with a dipole moment $\\vec{p}$ that points from the oxygen atom towards the midpoint between the hydrogen atoms. If a polar dielectric is subject to an external electric field, there will be no net force on the dipoles, but the dipole molecules will tend to orient in the electric field with the positive part of the dipole pointing in the direction of the local field. Without an applied electric field, the dipoles will point in random directions, with no net effect, but with an applied electric field, the dipoles will tend to align with the field. The stronger the field, the stronger will be the alignment and the stronger the net dipoles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us address in detail what happens when a molecule such as a water molecule is placed in an electric field $\\vec{E}$. We model the water as a two-charge dipole with a charge $q$ in a position $\\vec{d}/2$ relative to the center of the atom, in the middle between the hydrogen atoms, and a charge $-q$ at the oxygen atom at a position $-\\vec{d}/2$. If the field is uniform, the net force from the field is $q \\vec{E} - q \\vec{E} = 0$. However, the torque around the center of the molecule will be"

We write this the following way: $\\vec{P}(\\vec{E})$. The polarization vector is a function of the (local) electric field. Notice that the polarization is a function of the *total* electric field. Notice that it is the total field - including the field set up by all the dipoles in the material. This may initially seem a bit counterintuitive. The polarization is a function of the total electric field, but the polarization will also affect the electric field, which again will affect the polarization. We often call such relationships, or equations, self-consistent solutions. Mathematically, it is not difficult to set up such as relation, and we also understand the physics of this process: The polarization is due to the electric field that affects the atoms/molecules, and this electric field must be the total electric field, including the field set up by the displacement of the molecules themselves.\n",

    "We have now argued that the effect of an applied field on a dielectric material is a reorientation of permanent dipoles (for a polar dielectric), or a local displacement of the electron cloud to create dipoles (non-polar dielectric). While there are no free charges in the material, the small induced or aligned dipoles will lead to a distribution of charges in the dielectric material. We call these charges *bound charges*, because they are bound to the atoms or molecules and are not free to move around. Our plan is to relate the polarization $\\vec{P}$ to a density of bound volume and surface charges. We can then use this distribution of charges to calculate the electric field due to the bound charges, that is, the electric field due to the polarization.\n",

There are no net charges inside the volume, only the bound charges. Each small dipole in itself does not contribute with any net charge --- it has a positive and a negative end, with equal and opposite charges. However, if we look at a part of the system, such as the part inside the volume in Fig. [fig:polarization-boundcharge-010](#fig:polarization-boundcharge-010)a, then the bounding surface intersects some of the dipoles so that one side of the dipole is inside the volume and one side is outside the volume.

In this point, the polarization vector is $\\vec{P}$. We assume that the polarization is due to small dipoles with dipole moment $\\vec{p} = Q\\vec{d}$. We see that only dipoles that cross the surface contribute to the bound charge within the volume. Dipoles that are completely within the volume do not contribute to the net charge inside the volume since both the negative and the positive charges in the dipole are inside the volume and the *net* contribution is therefore zero. However, dipoles that cross the surface contribute to the net charge because only one part of the dipole is inside the volume. We see that all dipoles that are within a range $d \\cos \\theta = \\vec{d} \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{n}}$ cross the surface and hence contribute to the net bound charge inside the volume.

    "# Finding the electric field from polarization\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now seen than when dielectric materials are subject to electric fields, they will become polarized with a polarization $\\vec{P}$. If we know the polarization, we can use this to find the density of bound charges. The volume density of bound charge, $\\rho_{v,b} = - \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{P}$, and the surface density of bound charge at an interface between the dielectric and vacuum (or air) is $\\rho_{s,b} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$, where $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$ is the surface normal pointing from the dielectric into to vacuum/air. We can then calculate the electric field $\\vec{E}$ and the electric potential $V$ from the charge densities by integrating Coulomb's law on the appropriate form as we have learned to do previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Infinite polarized slab\n",
    "\n",
    "*An infinte dielectric slab of thickness $d$ in has a uniform polarization $\\vec{P}$ in the direction normal to the slab surface. Find the bound surface charge densities and the electric field in the slab.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig. [fig:polarization-infiniteslab-010](#fig:polarization-infiniteslab-010)a illustrates the geometry of the system. We choose the $x$-direction along $\\vec{P}$, so that $\\vec{P} = P \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$. Because the polarization is uniform inside the slab, we know that $\\rho_{v,b} = \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{P} = 0$ inside the slab. However, there may still be a surface charge density. For surface $S_1$, the surface normal is $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}_1 = \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$. We find the surface charge density from $\\rho_{s,b} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}_1 = P$. Similarly, for surface $S_2$ we have $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}_2 = -\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$ and $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}_2 = P \\mathbf{\\hat{x}} \\cdot -\\mathbf{\\hat{x}} = -P = - \\rho_{s,b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use the surface charge densities to find the electric field. For a surface charge density $\\rho_s$ on an infinite surface, we recall that the electric field only has a component normal to the surface, $\\vec{E} = E_x(x) \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$, and that the field is mirror symmetric around the surface: $E_x(x) = -E_x(-x)$. We find the electric field from Gauss' law on a cylindrical Gauss ==surface as illustrated in Fig. [fig:polarization-infiniteslab-010](#fig:polarization-infiniteslab-010)b. Only the cylinder end surfaces $\\Delta S$ contribute to the flux $\\Phi = 2 E_x \\Delta S = \\rho_s \\Delta_S/\\epsilon_0$ and therefore $E_x = \\rho_s/(2 \\epsilon_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find the electric field from the superposition of the field from the two bound surface charge densities $\\rho_{s,b}$ and $-\\rho_{s,b}$. We find that for $x>d/2$, the net field is $E_x = \\rho_s/(2 \\epsilon_0) - \\rho_s/(2 \\epsilon_0) = 0$. For $-d/2 < x < d/2$, the net field is $E_x = - \\rho_s/(2 \\epsilon_0) - \\rho_s/(2 \\epsilon_0) = - \\rho_s/\\epsilon_0 = - P/\\epsilon_0$. For $x<-d/2$, the two contributions cancel, $E_x = -\\rho_s/(2 \\epsilon_0) + \\rho_s/(2 \\epsilon_0) = 0$. The electric field (from the polarization $\\vec{P}$) is therefore $\\vec{E} = -P \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$ inside the slab. \n",
